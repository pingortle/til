# 2018-09-18

## vim

I started learning vim a couple weeks ago. I've just recently started really dipping into some custom stuff. Today I added a command to create these daily TIL.md files.

In `~/.vimrc`
```vimscipt
command! TIL execute "tabe" strftime("%Y-%m-%d.md")
```

This opens a new tab with a filename like `2018-09-18.md`.
