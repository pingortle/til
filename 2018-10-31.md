## `at`
TIL the `at` command. It allows you to queue up tasks to run later.

On macOS there are a few prerequisites to get this working, and I haven't figured it out yet! Will investigate further when I get some time.

Check `man at` for more info about the command itself. Check `man atrun` for info about how to get it running. I was not successful with the instructions on Mojave, so YMMV.

## macOS AppleScript notifications via `osascript`
[Docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/MacAutomationScriptingGuide/DisplayNotifications.html)
```
osascript -e 'display notification "tests passed!" with title "Terminal Notifications" subtitle "rspec" sound name "sosumi"'
```
