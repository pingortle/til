## Learning emacs to level up my terminal game
Ok so this has been bugging me for a while now in my recent neckbeard trial by fire. I have known <kbd>^w</kbd>, <kbd>^a</kbd> and <kbd>^e</kbd> for as long as I can remember, and use them reflexively all the time. Embarrassingly, I just discovered that these commands come from emacs, which I filed away as a nice bit of trivia that may come in handy someday. Today I reached a breaking point. In my conversion to iTerm2 I discovered that my <kbd>Alt+<arrow></kbd> habits would only print `[D` to the line. This led to a lot of tiny frustrations throughout the day as I had to mash the arrow keys many times to correct something in the middle of a one-liner. Just a few minutes ago I discovered a major macOS tip. macOS uses <kbd>Esc+</kbd> instead of <kbd>Alt+</kbd>. This should have been obvious to me from the `[D` output, but I just wasn't putting two and two together. The final inspiration for this TIL entry came when I remembered the emacs connection. I looked up an emacs text navigation cheat sheet, and discovered <kbd>M-b</kbd>, move back a word, and <kbd>M-f</kbd>, move forward a word. Add that to the <kbd>Esc+</kbd> replacement on Macs, and you have word-wise text navigation in the terminal again! One more tip for iTerm2 users is to go to `Preferences -> Profiles -> Keys` and remap your <kbd>option</kbd> key to <kbd>Esc+</kbd>.
